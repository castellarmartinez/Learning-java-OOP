### Knight’s Tour: Closed-Tour Test

In the Knight’s Tour (Exercise 7.22), a full tour occurs when the knight makes 64 moves, touching each square of the chessboard once and only once. A
closed tour occurs when the 64th move is one move away from the square in which the knight started
the tour. Modify the application you wrote in Exercise 7.22 to test for a closed tour if a full tour
has occurred.
