### Date and Time Class

Create class **DateAndTime** that combines the modified **Time2** class of
Exercise 8.7 and the modified **Date** class of Exercise 8.8. Modify method **incrementHour** to call
method **nextDay** if the time is incremented into the next day. Modify methods **toString** and **toUniversalString**
to output the date in addition to the time. Write a program to test the new class **DateAndTime**. 
Specifically, test incrementing the time to the next day.
