### Enhancing Class Date

Modify class **Date** of Fig. 8.7 to perform error checking on the initializer
values for variables **month**, **day** and **year** (currently it validates only the month and day). Provide
a method **nextDay** to increment the day by one. Write a program that tests method **nextDay** in
a loop that prints the date during each iteration to illustrate that the method works correctly. Test
the following cases:

    a) incrementing into the next month and
    b) incrementing into the next year.
