### Enhancing Class Time2

Modify class **_Time2_** of Fig. 8.5 to include a **_tick_** method that increments
the time stored in a **_Time2_** object by one second. Provide method _**incrementMinute**_ to increment
the minute by one and method _**incrementHour**_ to increment the hour by one. Write a
program that tests the **_tick_** method, the _**incrementMinute**_ method and the _**incrementHour**_ method
to ensure that they work correctly. Be sure to test the following cases:
    
    a) incrementing into the next minute,
    b) incrementing into the next hour and
    c) incrementing into the next day (i.e., 11:59:59 PM to 12:00:00 AM).
