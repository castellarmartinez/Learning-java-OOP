The Great Pyramid of Giza is considered an engineering
marvel of its time. Use the web to get statistics related to the Great Pyramid of Giza, and
find the estimated number of stones used to build it, the average weight of each stone, and the number
of years it took to build. Create an application that calculates an estimate of how much, by
weight, of the pyramid was built each year, each hour, and each minute as it was being built. The
application should input the following information:

    a) Estimated number of stones used.

    b) Average weight of each stone.

    c) Number of years taken to build the pyramid (assuming a year comprises 365 days).
