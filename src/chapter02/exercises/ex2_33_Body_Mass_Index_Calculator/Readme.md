### Body Mass Index Calculator

We introduced the body mass index (BMI) calculator in
Exercise 1.10. 

Create a BMI calculator that reads the user’s weight in pounds and height in inches (or, if you prefer,
the user’s weight in kilograms and height in meters), then calculates and displays the user’s
body mass index. Also, display the BMI categories and their values from the National Heart Lung
and Blood Institute

_http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm_

so the user can evaluate his/her BMI.

[Note: In this chapter, you learned to use the ***int*** type to represent whole numbers. The BMI
calculations when done with ***int*** values will both produce whole-number results. In Chapter 3
you’ll learn to use the ***double*** type to represent numbers with decimal points. When the BMI calculations
are performed with doubles, they’ll both produce numbers with decimal points—these
are called “floating-point” numbers.]
