(Factorial) The factorial of a nonnegative integer _n_ is written as _n_! (pronounced “_n_ factorial”)
and is defined for values of _n_ greater than or equal to 1 as:

_n_! = _n_ · (_n_ – 1) · (_n_ – 2) · … · 1

and for the n value 0 as:

_n_! = 1

For example, 5! = 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1, which is 120.

a) Write an application that reads a nonnegative integer and computes and prints its factorial.\
b) Write an application that estimates the value of the mathematical constant e by using
the following formula. Allow the user to enter the number of terms to calculate.


e = 1 + (1 / 1!) + (1 / 2!) + (1 / 3!) +...

c) Write an application that computes the value of ex by using the following formula. Allow
the user to enter the number of terms to calculate.

e^x = 1 + (x / 1!) + (x^2 / 2!) + (x^3 / 3!) +...
