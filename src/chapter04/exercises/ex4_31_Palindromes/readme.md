### Palindromes 

A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward.
For example, each of the following five-digit integers is a palindrome: 12321, 55555, 45554
and 11611. Write an application that reads in a five-digit integer and determines whether itâ€™s a palindrome.
If the number is not five digits long, display an error message and allow the user to enter
a new value.
