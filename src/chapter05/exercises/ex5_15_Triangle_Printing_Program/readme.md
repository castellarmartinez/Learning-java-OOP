### Triangle Printing Program

Write an application that displays the following patterns separately,
one below the other. Use _**for**_ loops to generate the patterns. All asterisks (*) should be printed
by a single statement of the form **_System.out.print('\*');_** which causes the asterisks to print side
by side. A statement of the form _**System.out.println();**_ can be used to move to the next line. A
statement of the form _**System.out.print(' ');**_ can be used to display a space for the last two patterns.
There should be no other output statements in the program. [_Hint_: The last two patterns require
that each line begin with an appropriate number of blank spaces.]
