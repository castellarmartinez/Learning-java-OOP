### Modified Compound-Interest Program

Modify the application in Fig. 5.6 to use only integers
to calculate the compound interest. [_Hint_: Treat all monetary amounts as integral numbers
of pennies. Then break the result into its dollars and cents portions by using the division and remainder
operations, respectively. Insert a period between the dollars and the cents portions.]
