### Calculating the Value of π

Calculate the value of π from the infinite series

π = 4 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 +4/9 - 4/11 +...

Print a table that shows the value of π approximated by computing the first 200,000 terms of this
series. How many terms do you have to use before you first get a value that begins with 3.14159?
