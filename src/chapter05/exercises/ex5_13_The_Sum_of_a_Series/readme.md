### The Sum of a Series

Find the summation of the sequence of numbers 1, 2, 3 â€¦ _n_, where
n ranges from 1 to 100. Use type **_long_**. Display the results in a tabular format that shows n and the
corresponding sum. If this were a product instead of a sum, what difficulty might you encounter
with the variable that accumulates the product?
