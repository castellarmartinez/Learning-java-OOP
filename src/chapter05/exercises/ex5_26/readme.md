A criticism of the _**break**_ statement and the continue statement is that each is unstructured.
Actually, these statements can always be replaced by structured statements, although doing so can
be awkward. Describe in general how you’d remove any _**break**_ statement from a loop in a program
and replace it with some structured equivalent. [_Hint_: The _**break**_ statement exits a loop from the
body of the loop. The other way to exit is by failing the loop-continuation test. Consider using in
the loop-continuation test a second test that indicates “early exit because of a ‘break’ condition.”]
Use the technique you develop here to remove the _**break**_ statement from the application in
