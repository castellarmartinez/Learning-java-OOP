### Class _PetrolPurchase_

Create a class called **_PetrolPurchase_** to represent information
about the petrol you purchase. The class should include five pieces of information in the form of
instance variables—the station’s location (type _String_), the type of petrol (type _String_), the quantity
(type _int_) of the purchase in liters, the price per liter (_double_), and the percentage discount
(_double_). Your class should have a constructor that initializes the five instance variables. Provide a
**set** and a **get** method for each instance variable. In addition, provide a method named **_getPurchaseAmount_** that calculates the net purchase amount (i.e., multiplies the quantity by the price per liter)
minus the discount, then returns the net amount you had to pay as a _double_ value. Write an application
class named **_Petrol_** that demonstrates the capabilities of class **_PetrolPurchase_**.
