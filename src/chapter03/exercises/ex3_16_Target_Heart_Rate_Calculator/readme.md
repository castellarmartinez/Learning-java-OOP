### Target-Heart-Rate Calculator

While exercising, you can use a heart-rate monitor to see
that your heart rate stays within a safe range suggested by your trainers and doctors. According to
the American Heart Association (AHA) (http://bit.ly/TargetHeartRates), the formula for calculating
your _maximum heart rate_ in beats per minute is 220 minus your age in years. Your _target
heart rate_ is a range that’s 50–85% of your maximum heart rate. [_Note_: These formulas are estimates
provided by the AHA. Maximum and target heart rates may vary based on the health, fitness and
gender of the individual. **Always consult a physician or qualified health-care professional before
beginning or modifying an exercise program**.] Create a class called **_HeartRates_**. The class attributes
should include the person’s first name, last name and date of birth (consisting of separate attributes
for the month, day and year of birth). Your class should have a constructor that receives this data as
parameters. For each attribute provide _set_ and _get_ methods. The class also should include a method
that calculates and returns the person’s age (in years), a method that calculates and returns the person’s
maximum heart rate and a method that calculates and returns the person’s target heart rate.
Write a Java app that prompts for the person’s information, instantiates an object of class **_HeartRates_** 
and prints the information from that object—including the person’s first name, last name and
date of birth—then calculates and prints the person’s age in (years), maximum heart rate and targetheart-
rate range.
