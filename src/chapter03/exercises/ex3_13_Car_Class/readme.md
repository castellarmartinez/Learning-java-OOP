### Car Class 

Create a class called _Car_ that includes three instance variables—a model (type
_String_), a year (type _String_), and a price (_double_). Provide a constructor that initializes the three
instance variables. Provide a **_set_** and a get method for each instance variable. If the price is not positive,
do not set its value. Write a test application named _CarApplication_ that demonstrates class _Car_’s capabilities.
Create two _Car_ objects and display each object’s price. Then apply a 5% discount on the
price of the first _car_ and a 7% discount on the price of the second. Display each _Car_’s price again.
