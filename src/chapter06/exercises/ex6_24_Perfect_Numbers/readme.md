### Perfect Numbers

An integer number is said to be a perfect number if its factors, including
1 (but not the number itself), sum to the number. For example, 6 is a perfect number, because 6 =
1 + 2 + 3. Write a method _**isPerfect**_ that determines whether parameter _**number**_ is a perfect number.
Use this method in an application that displays all the perfect numbers between 1 and 1000. Display
the factors of each perfect number to confirm that the number is indeed perfect. Challenge the computing
power of your computer by testing numbers much larger than 1000. Display the results.
