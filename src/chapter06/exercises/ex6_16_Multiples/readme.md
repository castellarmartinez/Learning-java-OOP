### Multiples

Write a method **isMultiple** that determines, for a pair of integers, whether the
second integer is a multiple of the first. The method should take two integer arguments and return
**true** if the second is a multiple of the first and **false** otherwise. [_Hint_: Use the remainder operator.]
Incorporate this method into an application that inputs a series of pairs of integers (one pair at a
time) and determines whether the second value in each pair is a multiple of the first.
