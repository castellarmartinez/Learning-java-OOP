### Divisible by 5

Write a method **isDivisible** that uses the remainder operator (%) to determine
whether ten input integers are divisible by 5 or not. The method should take an integer argument
and return **true** if the integer is divisible by 5 and **false** otherwise. Incorporate this method
into an application that inputs a sequence of integers (one at a time) and determines the result.
