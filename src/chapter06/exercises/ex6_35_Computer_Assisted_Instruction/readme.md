### Computer-Assisted Instruction

The use of computers in education is referred to as _computer-assisted instruction (CAI)_. Write a program that will help an elementary school student learn
multiplication. Use a _**SecureRandom**_ object to produce two positive one-digit integers. The program should then prompt the user with a question, such as

    How much is 6 times 7?

The student then inputs the answer. Next, the program checks the student’s answer. If it’s correct,
display the message _**"Very good!"**_ and ask another multiplication question. If the answer is wrong,
display the message _**"No. Please try again."**_ and let the student try the same question repeatedly
until the student finally gets it right. A separate method should be used to generate each new question.
This method should be called once when the application begins execution and each time the
user answers the question correctly.
