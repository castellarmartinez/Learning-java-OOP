### Beautifying Strings

Write methods that accomplish each of the following tasks:

a) Check whether the string is terminated by a full stop, and if not, add a full stop.\

b) Check whether the string starts with a capital letter, and if not, capitalize the first letter.\

c) Use the methods developed in parts (a) and (b) and to write a method _**beautifyString**_
that receives a string from the user, and then calls the methods in (a) and (b) to make
sure that the string is properly formatted, in other words, the string has a full stop at
the end, and a capitalized first letter. Make sure you output the string after it has been
beautified!
