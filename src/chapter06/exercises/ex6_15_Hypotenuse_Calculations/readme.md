### Hypotenuse Calculations

Define a method **hypotenuse** that calculates the hypotenuse of
a right triangle when the lengths of the other two sides are given. The method should take two arguments
of type **double** and return the hypotenuse as a **double**. Incorporate this method into an
application that reads values for **side1** and **side2** and performs the calculation with the **hypotenuse**
method. Use **Math** methods **pow** and **sqrt** to determine the length of the hypotenuse for each of the
triangles in Fig. 6.14. [_Note_: Class **Math** also provides method **hypot** to perform this calculation.]

    Triangle   Side 1   Side 2
    1          3.0       4.0
    2          5.0      12.0
    3          8.0      15.0
