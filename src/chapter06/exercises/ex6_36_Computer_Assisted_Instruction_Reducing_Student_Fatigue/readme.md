### Computer-Assisted Instruction: Reducing Student Fatigue

each answer as follows:

Possible responses to a correct answer:

    Very good!
    Excellent!
    Nice work!
    Keep up the good work!

Possible responses to an incorrect answer:

    No. Please try again.
    Wrong. Try once more.
    Don't give up!
    No. Keep trying.

Use random-number generation to choose a number from 1 to 4 that will be used to select
one of the four appropriate responses to each correct or incorrect answer. Use a _**switch**_ statement to
issue the responses.
