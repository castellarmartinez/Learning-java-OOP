### Computer-Assisted Instruction: Difficulty Levels

Exercises 6.35â€“6.37 developed a computer-assisted instruction program to help teach an elementary school student multiplication. Modify
the program to allow the user to enter a difficulty level. At a difficulty level of 1, the program
should use only single-digit numbers in the problems; at a difficulty level of 2, numbers as large as
two digits, and so on.
