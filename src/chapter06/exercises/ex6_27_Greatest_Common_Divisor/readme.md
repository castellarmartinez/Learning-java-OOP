### Greatest Common Divisor

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers is the largest
integer that evenly divides each of the two numbers. Write a method _**gcd**_ that returns the greatest
common divisor of two integers. [_Hint_: You might want to use Euclidâ€™s algorithm. You can find
information about it at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm.]  Incorporate the method
into an application that reads two values from the user and displays the result.
