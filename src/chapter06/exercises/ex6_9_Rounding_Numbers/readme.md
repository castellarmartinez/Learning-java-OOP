### Rounding Numbers 

_**Math.floor**_ can be used to round values to the nearest integerâ€”e.g.,

**_double y = Math.floor(x + 0.5);_**

will round the number x to the nearest integer and assign the result to y. Write an application that
reads **double** values and uses the preceding statement to round each of the numbers to the nearest
integer. For each number processed, display both the original number and the rounded number.
