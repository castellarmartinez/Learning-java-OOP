### Floor and Ceil

Write two methods **_myFloor_** and _**myCeil**_ that take a positive **double num**
variable **int myFloor(double num)** and **int myCeil(double num)**.

The **_myFloor_** method takes **num** and returns the largest integer number that is less than or equal to **_x_**.
The **_myCeil_** function takes **num** and finds the smallest number that is greater than or equal to **_x_**. Do
not use any **_Math_** class methods. Incorporate this method into an application that sends a double
value to the functions and tests their ability to calculate the required output.
