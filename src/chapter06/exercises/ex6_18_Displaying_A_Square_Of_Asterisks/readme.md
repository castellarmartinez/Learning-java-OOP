### Displaying a Square of Asterisks

Write a method **squareOfAsterisks** that displays a solid
square (the same number of rows and columns) of asterisks whose side is specified in integer parameter
side. For example, if **side** is 4, the method should display

    ****
    ****
    ****
    ****

Incorporate this method into an application that reads an integer value for side from the user and
outputs the asterisks with the **squareOfAsterisks** method.
