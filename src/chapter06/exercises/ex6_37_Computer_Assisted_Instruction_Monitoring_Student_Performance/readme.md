### Computer-Assisted Instruction: Monitoring Student Performance 

More sophisticated computer-assisted instruction systems monitor the student’s performance over a period of time. The
decision to begin a new topic is often based on the student’s success with previous topics. Modify
the program of Exercise 6.36 to count the number of correct and incorrect responses typed by the
student. After the student types 10 answers, your program should calculate the percentage that are
correct. If the percentage is lower than 75%, display _**"Please ask your teacher for extra help."**_,
then reset the program so another student can try it. If the percentage is 75% or higher, display
_**"Congratulations, you are ready to go to the next level!"**_, then reset the program so another
student can try it.
