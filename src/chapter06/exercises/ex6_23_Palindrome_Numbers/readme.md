### Palindrome Numbers 

A positive integer is a palindrome if its value is the same after reversing
the order of the digits in the number. For example, 12321 is a palindrome, but 12563 is not.
Write a method that determines whether a number is a palindrome. Use this method in an application
that determines whether a number entered by the user is a palindrome or not and prints the
result to the console.
